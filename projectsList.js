    description:`I fully replicated the Kabarak University student portal. The front-end is entirely similar to the actual portal,
     while I used the student flow within the system to try and build the backend.`,
    caseStudy:`For a long time, I had been fascinated by Javascript and its application in real-world scenarios. Having been introduced to the language as soon as 
    I began learning web development, I was a bit down-fallen that I could not use it across the board to build a full-stack application. However, as I delved deeper
    into developing web applications, I came across Node.js and the MERN tech stack. In a bid to master this stack and finally use Javascript for both 
    frontend and backend, I decided to replicate my Alma Mater, Kabarak University,'s student portal. This project provided me with a real test on how to implement
    my Javascript, problem-solving, and critical-thinking skills. The development of this portal is still underway and open for contributions from other Javascript
    developers`,
